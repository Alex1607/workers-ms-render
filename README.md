# Minesweeper Game Renderer

[![Deploy with Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/Alex1607/workers-ms-render)

This project is based on the [Rusty Minesweeper Render Bot](https://github.com/greeveu/RustyMsRenderBot) and my [Minesweeper Image Project](https://github.com/Alex1607/minesweeper-image).  
Both projects are written in Rust and use the same image generation code. I had to do some adjustments to make it work with Cloudflare Workers though. These are maily related to the WebP image format.
